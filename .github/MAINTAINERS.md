# Releases & Branching

**`master`**
- Contains only production-ready code
- Each commit is associated with one (and only one) issue
- Each commit is given a `LABEL:` and an issue number `(#000)`
- Tagging a commit creates a release

**issue branches**
- Branched directly from `master`
- Merged into `master` using a Squash & Merge commit
